AndroidEssentials2
==================

This repository contains the code examples from The Essentials of Android Application Development LiveLessons, 2nd Edition.  The video series is available at [InformIT](http://www.informit.com/store/essentials-of-android-application-development-livelessons-9780134068145).

Most of the files are the same as what you saw in the video series, but there have been a few changes.  The gradle version has been updated to the latest version as of 2015-03-08 and a package has been added for "launcher" content.  That package contains a new LauncherActivity, which is the only launcher activity now.  It just displays a list of the other activities from the video series, so you can quickly jump to whichever one you want.  The videos included quickly adding each new activity as a launcher activity, which is great for testing and demonstrating activities, but it gets messy quickly, so this LauncherActivity replaces that.

Note that the video series was created prior to the release of Android Studio, so some things may have changed.  For instance, Android Studio now has a nice wizard for downloading the latest SDK, so you don't have to download it separately.  Some of the generated files have been improved as well.
